This is a "dummy" project.. it has no real use on its own. It's only purpose is to reference all the class libraries in this solution, so that the assemblies,
the XML documentation files for the DLLs and all referenced assemblies can be in one place (the bin directory). This is then used by another app called Doxie, to generate
documentation from the DLLs and XML markup. See [Doxie Project](https://github.com/gordon-matt/Doxie) for more.
